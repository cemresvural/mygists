# Step 1: Import necessary libraries

# Step 5: Create an instance of the StandardScaler class

# Step 6: Fit the StandardScaler on features from the training set
sc.fit(X_train)

# Step 7: Use the "fit_transform" method on the training dataset

# Step 8: Apply the "transform" method on the test dataset (DO NOT fit again!)
